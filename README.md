## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require maltekuhr/laravel-gpt
```

Next you need to configure your OpenAI API Key and Organization ID. You can find both in the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).

```dotenv
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

You are now ready to use LaravelGPT! I recommend you to read the [Documentation](https://laravel-gpt.com).
